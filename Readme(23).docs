This is a C++ program that demonstrates how to open a file.
This program is using C++ file streams to open a file named tushar.txt in different modes, but it doesnâ€™t perform any actual reading or writing operations. 
I am using #inculde<iostream> Header file for input output operation
fstream opens the file in both read and write mode.
using namespace std; It is a template for global declaration
cin>> it is console input.
cout<< it is console output
{   } This is Curly braces
While it sets up these file streams, it doesn't perform any actual reading or writing, so it just shows how to initialize file streams with different modes.
Return 0; It is function return NULL value.

Output:	
Program did not output anything !
