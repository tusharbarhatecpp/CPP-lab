This is C++ program it writes text to a file named cpp.txt.
First, it uses ofstream to open the file for writing, creating it if it doesn’t already exist.
 Secodn, #inculde<iostream> Header file for input output operation
fstream opens the file in both read and write mode.
using namespace std; It is a template for global declaration
cin>> it is console input.
It then checks if the file is open and, if so, writes two lines of text: "Hello, World!" and "This is a text file in C++.
After writing, the program closes the file to ensure data is saved properly.
cout<< it is console output
If everything works, it displays "Data written to file successfully"; otherwise, it shows an error message indicating the file couldn’t be opened.
{   } This is Curly braces
While it sets up these file streams, it doesn't perform any actual reading or writing, so it just shows how to initialize file streams with different modes.
Return 0; It is function return NULL value.

Output:	
Data written to file successfully.
