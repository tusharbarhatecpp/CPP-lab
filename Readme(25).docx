This is a C++ program it creates a simple structure called Data with an id and a name.
This program makes an instance of Data with sample values and opens a file called "data.bin" to write in binary format.
I am using #inculde<iostream> Header file for input output operation
using namespace std; It is a template for global declaration.
If the file opens correctly, the program writes the data of Data to the file and then closes it.
cin>> it is console input.
cout<< it is console output
It displays a message saying whether the file was written successfully or if there was an error opening it.
{   } This is Curly braces
This method saves the data in binary format, making it quick to read and write.
Return 0; It is function return NULL value

Output:	
Data written successfully to binary file.
File name: data.bin
